I am an assistant professor of biostatistics at the [Institute for Informatics, Data Science, & Biostatistics](https://i2db.wustl.edu) at [Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis](https://medicine.wustl.edu). My research focuses on developing causal inference and machine learning for real-world evidence generation from electronic health records. I completed my PhD in Biomedical Informatics at [Columbia University](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu), advised by [George Hripcsak](http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/hripcsak/) and [David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/). I have a master's degree in Computational Biology from [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu) and a bachelor's degree from Boston University. Here is my [CV](https://linyingzhang.com/files/CV_linyingzhang.pdf).

My recent research has focused on addressing confounding bias in observational studies using real-world data, and explaining root causes of healthcare disparities with causal machine learning. My research interests include: 
1. developing federated causal machine learning for treatment effect estimation across multiple databases without sharing patient-level data.
2. developing heterogeneous and individualized treatment effect estimation algorithms for personalized treatment planning.
3. improving the equity of health care through machine learning.

**HIRING!** I am open to mentor graduate and undergraduate students. I am also looking for full-time [data analysts](https://wustl.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/External/details/Senior-Statistical-Data-Analyst---Biostatistics_JR78752) and [postdoc](https://wustl.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/External/job/Postdoctoral-Research-Associate---Biostatistics_JR78995) researchers. Please email me your CV and a cover letter if you are interested in working in my lab.
